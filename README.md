Simple Command-Line To-Do List Manager (Python) Project Overview This project creates a simple and persistent Command-Line Interface (CLI) app. It helps users manage their daily tasks and to-do lists quickly. The goal of this project is to provide an easy-to-use task manager that solves the common issue of organizing daily tasks. The main feature is persistence. Tasks save automatically to a local file, so the list remains intact across sessions. Objective The main goal is to give users a reliable and persistent numbered list of tasks through a simple, user-friendly command-line interface. Technology Used Language: Python 3 Libraries: The standard os module to check if files exist. Storage: A plain text file (todo_list.txt) for saving data. How to Run the Application Prerequisites You need to have Python 3 installed on your system. Installation and Execution Save the Code: Save the provided Python code into a file named todo_manager.py. Open Terminal: Navigate to the directory where you saved the file using your command line (Terminal, Command Prompt, or PowerShell). Run the Script: Launch the application with this command: python todo_manager.py Data Persistence When you run the application for the first time, it will create a new file named todo_list.txt in the same directory. This file will store your tasks and be used to load them every time the application starts. Application Usage The manager has a simple, looping menu: View Current List: The list shows automatically upon startup and after every action. Add a New Task (Option 1): Enter 1 and press Enter. Type the task description when prompted. The task gets added and saved right away. Remove a Task (Option 2): Enter 2 and press Enter. Type the number (index) of the task you want to remove (e.g., enter 1 to remove the first task). The task will be removed and saved. Exit and Save (Option 3): Enter 3 and press Enter to close the program safely. Code Design Highlights The program structure is clear and organized, with a focus on separating different functions: DATA_FILE & todo_list: Global variables manage the file path and the list shown in memory. load_tasks() & save_tasks(): These functions handle all file input and output tasks, ensuring data stays accurate. add_task() & remove_task(): These functions manage the main logic for changing the list, validating actions, and saving changes immediately. main_menu(): This function contains the user interaction loop, loading tasks at the start and providing continuous menu options. Future Enhancements The project can be improved with additional features, such as: Marking Tasks as Complete: Adding a way to toggle a task's completion status (e.g., [X] Buy milk). Task Editing: Allowing users to change an existing task's text without deleting and re-adding it. Prioritization: Adding priority levels (e.g., [HIGH], [LOW]) and sorting the display accordingly.
